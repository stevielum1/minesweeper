# Minesweeper

![minesweeper](/docs/minesweeper.png)

This is a console based minesweeper. You must uncover each tile that does not contain a mine. The board size is 10x10. You can choose how many mines you want, though I recommend 10 for easy, 15 for medium, and 20 for hard.

### Installation
Run the following commands in your terminal:
1. `git clone https://github.com/stevielum1/minesweeper.git`
2. `cd minesweeper`
3. `gem install colorize`
4. `ruby minesweeper.rb`

Now go have fun!
